Were there any lucky finds or incredible hauls? 🎒

We've covered Brunswick and Fitzroy, where should we hop to next? 🐸

Did you know that on average each Australian buys 56 items of clothing each year? Purchasing items from secondhand or op shops is one way to mitigate the impact and contribute to the circular economy! ♻️

Our turnout last Friday at our CTF event was so impressive. 👏
We’ve been having the best time here at #DUCA bringing the most engaging events to Deakin University! 🎉

Even if you’re not too much of a social butterfly, we know you’ll love our CTFs — whether you work on them with others or by yourself! 💻

A huge thank you to our team members @dhl.inc and @kapoorsahabbb for organising the CTF challenges and presenting! 🙌

Our next event is just over 24 hours away, and we are so excited to see everyone to explore the new Cyber Security Bill of 2024! 🛡️

– With love,
The DUCA Team 💙</p><img src="21.jpg"/><p>A couple of weeks ago, we hosted an eye-opening session on #authentication and #MFA — diving into how digital security has evolved and why it matters more than ever.

From exploring the history of passwords to hands-on demos (including a phishing simulation 👀), we saw firsthand how easily credentials can be compromised — and how MFA adds critical layers of protection.

Big thanks to everyone who joined us! Let’s keep pushing for stronger, smarter digital habits. 💡

#duca #cybersecurity #cyber #fyp #reels #australia #university #student #explore #relatable</p><img src="23.jpg"/><p>As you can tell, #DUCACat had a wonderful time at the inaugural BSides Ballarat on 3-4 May. 🐈 He has given us permission to share some of his favourite pictures from the event. 

Here is a great summary from our fellow DUCA committee member @ashleyyyy._.12 on her experience at BSides this month! 

"Never too late to post… still can’t stop thinking about BSides Ballarat this past weekend!...

The day was packed with moments that really stuck with me.

David Mulraney talked about building from nothing, staying connected (even with your competition!) and staying hungry, honestly, so many real insights I’ll hold on to, especially as someone who dreams of having something of my own someday.

Erica Muir from IBM had such an insightful talk that went beyond just the technicals. Breaking down how much fraud investigation relies on understanding human behaviour and psychology, not just tools or systems. It reminded me how broad cybersecurity really is and how important it is to think both like an analyst and a detective when chasing down threats and suspicious patterns.

Gyle D. absolutely nailed the issue of oversharing. The way we casually put so much of our personal data out there? Definitely left me wanting to review my own habits and stay smarter about my digital footprint.

Martijn van Praag with the live demo and explanation of how CTI can be automated showed me how fast this area is evolving. Felt super inspired (and a little spooked xD) to keep my skills sharp and stay ahead of the curve.

Rue Maharaj with most relatable talks of the day for me. His advices of how to keep growing in cybersecurity and how cyber careers not being a straight path was refreshing and exactly what I needed to hear. It’s okay to pivot as you grow. He also spoke about how easy it is to burnout in this field and making sure to take care of yourself along the way. Something I’m looking forward to carry with me, growth is important, but so is protecting your energy...

I couldn’t attend every single talk but these ones really left a mark on me.

Events like this remind me how much I love being part of this community. #Networking #BSidesBallarat."
